    "# Toy Problem for RL Pathfinding\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook is a simplified exploration of an RL-based pathfinding algorithm. We setup a 10x10 grid and implement Q-learning as our algorithm.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Fundamentals of RL\n",
    "Reinforcement-Learning is a technique in machine learning where an agent is tasked with interacting within a specified environment. The agent takes an action $a$ during the current state of the environment $s$. The optimal action $a$ is decided by maximising a reward.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Learning Algorithms\n",
    "The learning algorithm that we'll be using is Q-learning defined as:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "Q_\\textrm{new}(s, a) \\leftarrow (1-\\alpha)Q(s,a)+\\alpha(r+\\gamma\\cdot \\max_{a^\\prime}Q(s^\\prime, a^\\prime))\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "- $Q(s, a)$ is the current $Q$ value, aka the quality.\n",
    "- $\\alpha$ is the learning rate\n",
    "- $r$ is the reward contribution from taking action $a$\n",
    "- $\\gamma$ is the discount factor for how much we value future rewards\n",
    "- $\\max_{a^\\prime}Q(s^\\prime, a^\\prime)$ returns the maximum $\\mathbf{Q}$-value in the next state $s^\\prime$ having taken action $a^\\prime$."
